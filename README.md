# üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech App (AWS + Terraform)

A serverless **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** application built using **AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Amazon Polly, and S3**, with infrastructure provisioned by **Terraform**.  
This project was developed as my **capstone project** to demonstrate knowledge of AWS cloud services.

---

## üìå Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to design and implement a **scalable, serverless application** that converts user-provided text into natural-sounding speech.  
It showcases the use of AWS services for compute, storage, and AI, combined with Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## üöÄ Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

**Flow:**
1. **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)** ‚Üí User inputs text.  
2. **API Gateway** ‚Üí Exposes `/synthesize` route.  
3. **Lambda Function (Python)** ‚Üí Uses **Amazon Polly** to generate speech and saves the output in **S3**.  
4. **Amazon S3** ‚Üí Stores audio files.  
5. **Presigned URL** ‚Üí Returned to frontend, allowing the user to download or play the audio file.

## ‚ú® Features
- Convert text into speech (MP3 format).  
- Secure, scalable, and serverless architecture.  
- Real-time response with presigned URLs.  
- Simple frontend interface.  
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **AWS Lambda** (Python runtime)  
- **Amazon API Gateway v2 (HTTP API)**  
- **Amazon Polly** (Text-to-Speech)  
- **Amazon S3** (Static website + audio storage)  
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure provisioning)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account  
- Terraform installed  
- Live Server extension (VS Code) or S3 static hosting   

### Deployment
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/text-to-speech.git
   cd text-to-speech
   
##Challenges & Solutions

CORS Errors ‚Üí Fixed by updating API Gateway route and Lambda response headers.

403 Access Denied on S3 ‚Üí Resolved by setting correct bucket policies and enabling static hosting.

Lambda Permissions ‚Üí Allowed API Gateway to invoke Lambda using IAM role/policy.

##Future Improvements

Add user authentication with Amazon Cognito.

Support multiple languages and voices.

Store usage logs in DynamoDB.

Add a React/Vue frontend for richer UI.
